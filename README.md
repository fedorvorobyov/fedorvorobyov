# Hi, I'm Fedor

Python developer specializing in automation, bots, and data extraction.

I build tools that save businesses hours of manual work every week — from Telegram bots and web scrapers to Google Sheets automations with live dashboards and email alerts.

## What I Do

**Telegram & Discord Bots** — product catalogs, admin panels, payment integration, notifications

**Web Scraping & Data Extraction** — any website, retry logic, rate limiting, clean CSV/JSON output

**Google Sheets Automation** — Apps Script dashboards, API integrations, auto-reports, email alerts

## Tech Stack
